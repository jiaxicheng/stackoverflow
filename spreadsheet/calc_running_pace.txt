GoogleSheet formular to convert running speed (mph or mile per hour) into running pace (minutes per mile)
or from running distance (column `miles`) and running time (column `minutes`)

(1) from mph to pace

   =Text(1/mph/24, "m:ss:000")     

this will convert mph=7.35 into `8:09:796`


(2) the following do the same from miles and minutes

   =Text(minutes/miles/1440, "m:ss:000")

Note, in Pivot table, add a calculated field:
  
     Values -> Columns -> Add  -> Calculated Field

  Formula
     
     =minutes/miles/1440

  Summarized by: SUM
  Show as: Default

And then format the column w/

  Format -> Number -> Custom date and time 

Here you can select 
   Minute(1) - Minutes without leading zero
   Second(01) - Second with leading zero
   Millisecond(001) - Precision of 1/1000 of a second(001)


Note: The key is to convert the minutes/mile or hours/mile into days/mile, and then use Text()
      function to format the datetime field with specific format, in our case `m:ss:000`
