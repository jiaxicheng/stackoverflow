"""Pandas's rolling() function works only backwards, you can set the right end (or the center) of the windows, 
but not the left end. If you want to calculate a forward rolling() statistics i.e. the sum(), you will need 
to do some tricks. 

Method-1: 
    Calculate the rolling in the regular backward way and then assign the values to .shift(1-d) where 
    'd' is the window size. the problem for this approach is the last (d-1) rows will have NaN values 
    since the dates required for calculation cross the existing date range boundary. 

    One solution for this is to reindex() the dataframe by extending the existing date_range (as index) to 
    include the extra d-size window using the pd_date_range function and fill the NaNs which best fit the 
    application's logic. Using reindex() has another benefit in solving the potential missing date issues 
    which shift() function can not identify.

Method-2: 
    Reverse the date field and calculate the regular backward rolling and then flip it back. 
    The problems is that rolling only support a window based on number of records, not a datetime delta. 
    you will have to make sure the dates are continue and without gap. 

In the following stackoverflow case, OP wanted to check visiting status (True/False) in the next `d` days' window.
